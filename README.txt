Hi! Welcome to "Services, Processes and Binder"!

  This workshop will be a very deep and technical dive into the
guts of the Android framework.  If you are new to Android it may
be a stretch.

  This will not be a lecture!  It is very much my intention that
you leave this workshop with actual experience developing the
constructs that it introduces. You will get much more out of it if
you actually code.  I will be live-coding and I encourage you to
follow along.  In addition there will be several coding exercises.
You are more than welcome to work as teams, if you have the
opportunity.

  The framework code for the workshop at:

	https://github.com/bmeike/ServiceExperiment.git

  The repo contains four applications (app[0,1,2], svc]
and a library (lib). Please be sure that you can compile
and run them all (they may crash), *before* you head to
the conference.  Wifi is always spotty and Gradle is a
pig. You will not be happy if you are sitting in the back
of the room, trying to download the most recent version
of gradle.

  I recommend that you have Java 1.8.0_131 installed. 
Any Java 8 should be sufficient. The project was built
with the current Canary AndroidStudio, 3.0. and uses
Gradle 4.1-milestone-1.  It uses grade plugin
3.0.0-alpha6 BuildTools 26.0.0 and Android SDK 26.  I've
run it on a Pixel emulator, running O.

  Other configurations may work but please test to
confirm. In particular, some of the code does really
horrible things to the UI thread and may not work at all
on a real device.

  I look forward to working with you!  Come curious and
ready to code.

Blake Meike
